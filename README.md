# SurgeTracker
An iOS phone app to track labor contractions.  Got it working on my personal phone, but never published it to the App Store.

Written in Xamarin for Mac.

Demonstrated development on a Mac, using the Xamarin software to produce an iOS app using C#.  Also demonstrated publishing the app to my personal phone for testing.

## Features
* screen to stop and start the timers, similar to the 'lap' functionality of stop watches
* screen to show the previous 'laps', showing duration of each and duration between each.
